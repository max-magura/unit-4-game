# Max's Crystal Game 

This is a game I made to continue learning javascript with the addition of jQuery.

## Gameplay
The object of the game is to correctly match your total score to the random number that is generated. Each round, each crystal is given a new number value. Click the crystals to add them to your total score. If you match the random number, you win that round. If you go over, you loose.
